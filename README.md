## Flutter Challenge for Refactoring

This is a demo project where `lib/main.dart` is kind of a mess. All the components are hard coded in the file. 

So your task is to make it more convenient and easy to read, with whatever ways you know. Sky is your limit.

We are expecting `lib/main.dart` to be as short as possible. You may use  MVVM or MVC architectural structures as you wish.

## How to perform the task

We will be expecting a Pull Request which contains all code for completely working project to the `main` branch.

We will NOT merge the Pull Request, only review on it, whether it's correct or not.

If you have any questions, or suggestions for the future challenges, please open an Issue on this repo.
